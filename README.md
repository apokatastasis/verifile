The purpose of this program is simply to show the user all files in the current directory that are valid files on Linux but would not be valid under a Windows filesystem. When invoked from a terminal, all invalid entries are printed along with the offending character(s) in the entry name. 

Run `verifile --help' for some (hopefully) useful documentation.
